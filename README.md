Fairly early stage prototype of something called as a Data Infrastructure Assistant - https://render-dda.onrender.com/. 

Try the following prompts 
- ‘What is the Calculation behind metric TotalRevenue’
- ‘Calculation behind metric TotalRevenue’
- ‘In which table is the column TotalAmount’
- ‘Is there a table that contains details of an order from a customer’

Please see the problem it aims to solve and the solution, 

Problem :
Quick and easy access to metadata (data dictionary, metric definitions) has been a challenge across organizations.

Data teams often struggle with finding information about their data assets. When building out any dataset, teams often have to rely on individual people for this knowledge. Documentation has always been a pet peeve for all the data teams that I have worked on and often is lowest on the priority list of things to do for engineers.


Solution :
With Data Infrastructure Assistant, we aim to solve the above problem (think Google/Perplexity) for your data infrastructure. Vision is, to provide easy accessible information to the data teams.
