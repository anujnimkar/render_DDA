Please see the problem it aims to solve and the solution, 

**Problem :**
Quick and easy access to metadata (data dictionary, metric definitions) has been a challenge across organizations.

Data teams often struggle with finding information about their data assets. When building out any dataset, teams often have to rely on individual people for this knowledge. Documentation has always been a pet peeve for all the data teams that I have worked on and often is lowest on the priority list of things to do for engineers.


**Solution :**
With Data Infrastructure Search, the aim is to solve the above problem by providing quick and easy access to metrics for data teams. Think (Google/Perplexity) for your data infrastructure. 

**Vision :** 
Simplify data discovery for data teams.
